## Task

1. Read all skills: `~/.claude/skills/*.md`
2. Review this conversation for:
   - Corrections made to your behavior
   - Patterns that worked well
   - User preferences discovered
   - Mistakes to avoid
3. For each learning, determine which skill it belongs to (or if new skill needed)
4. Propose specific edits - show diff-style changes
5. Wait for approval before editing

Keep skills lean. Don't add what's already covered.
